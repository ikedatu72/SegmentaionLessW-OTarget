This repository serves as a code reference for the publication [will be added later]

Calculating Effective Elastic Properties of Berea Sandstone Using Segmentation-less Method without Targets 

MATLAB codes used in the publication are converted to Python 3. All codes are for demonstration purpose and have not been optimized for the sake of simplicity.   

Please see "CodeDemonstration.ipynb" for the demonstration. Note that we only use the subsample from the full CT-images.
